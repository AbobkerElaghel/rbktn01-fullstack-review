mango db does not require you to spifiy the data type not the reltionships between them and also it stores data into something called document and collations
not into tables as mysql and RD systems and its an NoSQL database so thats that
mango does not store data in tables and rows and like that, NoSQL databases e.g.. MangoDB stores data in collection of document , document are very similur to javascript Object and thier type is called BSON its very similar to JSON Object but with added data types
in MangoDB , databases is just like the normal MYSQL databases;
but to store info you need to create a collection , collection is similar to a table, which you can hold in to it multiple documents of data
all documents on MangoDB must have a _ID which is object id,its kind og the same of primary key in SQL databases
so to create a database in MangoDB you use the comment user <database> ,(note that a database well only be created when you create a collection)

TO insert a document into the collection you use the following command
db.<collection>.insert(BSON_OBJECT);
e.g..
test.student.insert({
  name:'abobker',
  avg:90,
  id_number:171069
})
so as shown above MangoDB does not follow a strict table model like SQL databases, you can just insert a object into the collection and thats it! no resrections what so ever , the type just need to be a BSON and that all
and to insert multiple documents you need to user the command
db.<collection>.insertMany(ARRAY OF BSON_OBJECTS);

to query from one of the collections you use the fucntion find();
